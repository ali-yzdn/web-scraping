*Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

-   Open the Jupyter Notebook  named part_1_mars_news.ipynb. 

-   Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news siteLinks to an external site. 

-   Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.

-   Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures as follows:

-   Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview. 

-   Print the list in your notebook.


*Part 2: Scrape and Analyse Mars Weather Data

-   Open the Jupyter Notebook named part_2_mars_weather.ipynb. 

-   Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data SiteLinks to an external site, 

-   The URL is https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html.

-   Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table. 

-   Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. 

-   Here’s an explanation of the column headings:

id: the identification number of a single transmission from the Curiosity rover

terrestrial_date: the date on Earth

sol: the number of elapsed sols (Martian days) since Curiosity landed on Mars

ls: the solar longitude

month: the Martian month

min_temp: the minimum temperature, in Celsius, of a single Martian day (sol)

pressure: The atmospheric pressure at Curiosity's location

Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column. If necessary, cast (or convert) the data to the appropriate datetime, int, or float data types.


-   Analyse your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:

How many months exist on Mars?

How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?

What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:

Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.

Plot the results as a bar chart.

Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:

Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.

Plot the results as a bar chart.

About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:

Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.

Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.

Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
